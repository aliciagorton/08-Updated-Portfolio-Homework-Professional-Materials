    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Ensure that your portfolio is free of grammar and spelling mistakes

### Design:  Your site should look"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

1. Professional profile picture

   * A photo or an image other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)

4. Email address

5. Link to your portfolio
